# DARE IT challenge portfolio - QA Manual Testing :mag:

<p align="justify">What is a challenge portfolio? This is a 7-week challenge organised by [DARE IT](https://www.dareit.io/challenges/qa-manual-testing), the result of which is the complete QA Manual testing project. Each week there were different tasks performed in weekly sprints. Throughout the course, I was able to ask questions to the mentors. During the challenge, I had the opportunity to learn how to use many tools such as Jira, Slack, Chrome DevTools, MySQL and ]Markdown.</p>
