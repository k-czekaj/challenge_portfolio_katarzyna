## **Subtask 3 - Why do we write test cases?** ✍️
<p align=justify>Test cases allow us to systematize the application testing process. Thanks to this we can ensure in a structured and measurable way that the application is of high quality and works as required. During the process of creating test cases we think about the application from the user's perspective. Thanks to this we are able to test more functionalities than in the case of testing without a plan. In addition writing test cases helps new people to recreate the tests in the future even if they have no knowledge of the application.</p>
